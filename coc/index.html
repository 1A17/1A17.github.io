We with Wolf-Pack Alpha and Omega understand that being part of multiple Discord Servers is just kind of a thing nowadays. However, having a certain channel or the whole server itself muted, and then proclaiming &quot;you didn&#39;t get the message because you have us muted&quot; will not be considered a sufficient or justifiable reason for not &quot;getting the message&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">*This is for all discord server ranks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">*Definition of discord server ranks: Wolf-Pack Omega and under.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">*Reminder that contacting a Corporate rank requires a possible immediate to 48 hour window of response.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">*Definition of Corporate rank: Advisory Team and Higher.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">15.
